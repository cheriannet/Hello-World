Hi Everyone!

This is [Cherian Paul](https://github.com/cheriannet). I live in Houston, TX, USA. :earth_americas: 

I love writting code. I live, eat, sleep and dream code. In 1994, I wrote my first code before I even used any computer :computer: or read any books :books: on programming. It was in a Math Class, they had a chapter for [GW-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC) programming. I was 15 years old at that time. :blush:

Even though I have been programming ever since, I am very new to Github and Open Source Programming. 

I :heart: to help other programmers. If you need any help contact me on [Github](https://github.com/cheriannet). 

Thank you! 

Cherian Paul.
